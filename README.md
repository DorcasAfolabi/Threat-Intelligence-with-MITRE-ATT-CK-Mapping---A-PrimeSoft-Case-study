# Threat-Intelligence-with-MITRE-ATT-CK-Mapping-A-PrimeSoft-Case-study
I Analyzed a set of IP addresses from PrimeSoft's SSH logs, firewall and emails, enriched the IP addresses using VirusTotal and mapped them to Techniques on MITRE ATTA&amp;CK Framework.
## Background
As part of my role within the Threat Intelligence unit at PrimeSoft Solutions, I contribute to securing client platforms and safeguarding sensitive information against evolving cyber threats. With phishing attacks and credential-based intrusions becoming increasingly sophisticated, PrimeSoft is strengthening its Threat Intelligence function to proactively detect malicious activity, enrich Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), and provide actionable insights for both security teams and executive decision-makers.This project reflects my active involvement in building that capabilityâ€”analyzing real security events, correlating multi-source indicators, and translating technical findings into intelligence that supports both operational defense and strategic risk management.

## Tools and Technology used
### VirusTotal
### MITRE ATT&CK Framework
